# G05_KeaProject
软件开发第五组Kea系统代码仓库

## Intro(概要介绍)
Kea is a general and practical testing tool based on the idea of property-based testing for finding functional (logic) bugs in mobile (GUI) apps. Kea currently supports Android and HarmonyOS.
This project has optimized and enhanced the large model guidance path traversal strategy (LLMPolicy) for Kea, with the main tasks including:
1. Improved the UI trap detection mechanism by adopting multi-modal similarity judgment.
2. Enhanced the completeness of status description by adding key component information.
3. Optimized the LLM prompt engineering by adding business scenario context.
4. Implemented a context saving and reuse mechanism for UI traps.
